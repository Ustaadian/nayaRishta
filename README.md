### *Service Design Analysis of Pakistan's Remarriage System*

> **"Everyone deserves a system that supports their second chance, not one that punishes them for it."**

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Naya Rishta** (New Relationship) is a service design research project analyzing Pakistan's complex remarriage system. Through comprehensive system mapping, we've created a detailed knowledge graph to identify pain points and improvement opportunities for people navigating divorce, widowhood, and remarriage processes.

## 📋 The Problem

Imagine finding someone to marry after a divorce or death of your spouse, but you can't marry them due to social and legal permission delays that drag on for months. This is the reality for millions in Pakistan.

### Current Journey: A Bureaucratic Nightmare
**The Path:** Person → Union Council → Family Court → Arbitration Council → NADRA → Municipal Office → Back to Union Council

- **6+ months minimum** for simple divorce cases
- **Multiple government departments** with no integration
- **Manual processes** dominating the landscape
- **Gender-specific barriers** affecting women disproportionately

## 🎯 What We've Built

### Complete Knowledge Graph
A comprehensive mapping of Pakistan's remarriage system including:

- **12 Systems** - From Union Council divorce filing to NADRA marriage updates
- **5 Processes** - Divorce, Widowhood, First Marriage, Remarriage, Additional Marriage
- **20 Roles** - All stakeholders from government officials to applicants
- **8 Departments** - Government units involved
- **20 Documents** - Forms, certificates, and legal papers required
- **10 System Interfaces** - Potential integration opportunities

### System Analysis Features
- **UUID-based unique identifiers** for easy knowledge graph creation
- **Complexity and accessibility ratings** for each system
- **Time factor analysis** with realistic processing expectations
- **Comprehensive relationship mapping** between all entities

## 🔍 Key Insights Discovered

### Critical Bottlenecks
- **NADRA appears in 10+ systems** - Central bottleneck requiring integration
- **Only 3 hybrid systems** out of 12 total (rest are manual)
- **Zero integration** between departments currently
- **46 role-step interactions** showing coordination complexity

### Process Complexity Rankings
1. **First Marriage** - Simplest (1-3 days)
2. **Remarriage** - Moderate complexity  
3. **Additional Marriage** - Most complex (2-4 weeks, requires existing wife consent)
4. **Widowhood** - Variable (2 weeks to months depending on property disputes)
5. **Divorce** - Most time-consuming (6+ months minimum)

### Gender-Specific Challenges
- **Women seeking divorce** face additional court requirements (Khula vs Talaq)
- **Female remarriage candidates** encounter more social barriers
- **Existing wife consent** required for polygamous marriages

## 🌍 International Inspiration

### 🇪🇪 Estonia's Digital Solution
- 100% digital government services
- 30-day cooling period built into system
- One physical meeting required

### 🇧🇷 Brazil's One-Office Solution

## 🛠️ Technical Details

The knowledge graph JSON is designed for:
- **Graph database import** (Neo4j, etc.)
- **Network visualization tools**
- **Service design analysis**
- **System integration planning**

### Data Structure
- **Complete relationship mapping** between all entities
- **Integration potential assessment** for each system interface
- **Scalable structure** for additional research
