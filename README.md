## üöÄ Project Overview

**Naya Rishta** (New Relationship) is a service design research project analyzing Pakistan's complex remarriage system. Through comprehensive system mapping, we've created a detailed knowledge graph to identify pain points and improvement opportunities for people navigating divorce, widowhood, and remarriage processes.

## üìã The Problem

Imagine finding someone to marry after a divorce or death of your spouse, but you can't marry them due to social and legal permission delays that drag on for months. This is the reality for millions in Pakistan.

### Current Journey: A Bureaucratic Nightmare
**The Path:** Person ‚Üí Union Council ‚Üí Family Court ‚Üí Arbitration Council ‚Üí NADRA ‚Üí Municipal Office ‚Üí Back to Union Council

### The Human Impact
1. **Divorced individuals** struggling through complex remarriage procedures
2. **Widows and widowers** facing bureaucratic barriers during vulnerable times
3. **Women in messy divorces** - Pakistan being a patriarchal society creates obstacles for women to get proper documentation
4. **Widows dealing with property disputes** - opposing families often block access to necessary documents
5. **Illiterate citizens** who can't navigate different bureaucratic hoops to complete documentation
6. **People avoiding documentation entirely** - some lie about marrying for the first time, risking court cases that could send the groom, bride, witnesses, and marriage registrar to jail or monetary fines

## üéØ What We've Mapped

### Complete System Analysis
Our knowledge graph captures:

| Entity Type | Count | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **Systems** | 12 | Government workflows with complexity and accessibility ratings |
| **Processes** | 5 | Legal pathways from divorce to remarriage |
| **Steps** | 12 | Detailed breakdown of process requirements |
| **Roles** | 20 | All people involved in the remarriage system |
| **Departments** | 8 | Government organizations operating the systems |
| **Documents** | 20 | Forms, certificates, and paperwork required |
| **Stages** | 8 | User journey phases with emotional states |

### Key Insights from the Data

**System Complexity:**
- Most complex: Family Court Divorce (Level 5) - requires lawyer, multiple hearings, legal documentation
- Simplest: Union Council Marriage Registration (Level 2) - straightforward when documents are complete

**Processing Times:**
- Fastest: Hospital Death Certificate (1-3 days)
- Slowest: Family Court Divorce (up to 3 months)
- Most Variable: Property Inheritance Documentation (up to 3 months, can be contentious)

**System Types:**
- **Manual Systems:** Union Council processes, Family Courts, Arbitration Council
- **Hybrid Systems:** NADRA processes (online application + center verification)

### Process Complexity Ranking
1. **First Marriage Process** - Streamlined, 1-3 days when prepared
2. **Remarriage Process** - Requires completion of prior legal processes
3. **Widowhood Process** - 2-4 weeks for straightforward cases
4. **Additional Marriage Process** - Most complex due to consent requirements
5. **Divorce Process** - 6+ months minimum for simple cases

## üåç International Best Practices

### üá™üá™ Estonia's Digital Solution
Estonia achieved 100% Digital Government Service:
1. One partner fills out the application through the population registry portal, which is pre-filled with existing data
2. Mandatory 30-day cooling-off reflection period, but built into the digital system
3. Only one physical meeting with an official is required to finalize the divorce
4. Digital tools for dividing marital property and guidance for custody agreements included in the system

### üáßüá∑ Brazil's One-Office Solution
Brazil allows "pure and simple divorce" registration directly at Civil Registry Offices (Cart√≥rio) for consensual cases:
1. One office where consensual divorces can be processed directly at civil registry
2. If amicable and no children involved, can be done without court proceedings
3. Some registry offices offer 24-hour civil registry services

## üìä System Improvements Identified

Based on our analysis, the following improvements have been identified:

1. **Better system awareness** - Clear, accessible information about the process and requirements
2. **Enhanced NADRA services** - Expand their existing SMS service (send NIC to get details) to include marital status verification and spouse information
3. **Early digital notification** - Simple system to register the start of divorce proceedings OR death certificate process, automatically updating all relevant departments when someone becomes divorced or widowed
4. **One-stop service center** - Streamlined process for:
   - Consensual divorce cases without property or custody disputes (like Brazil's model)
   - Death certificate registration to officially declare widow/widower status
   - Both leading directly to remarriage eligibility without multiple office visits
