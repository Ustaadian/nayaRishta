## Core Entity Definitions

### Systems
**Definition:** Specific workflows or procedures that citizens must complete to achieve a particular outcome in the remarriage process.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Represents actual user touchpoints and interactions
- Has defined inputs, outputs, and processing steps
- Can be manual, digital, or hybrid in nature
- Measured by complexity, accessibility, and time requirements
- Examples: "Union Council Divorce Filing," "NADRA Certificate Processing"

### Roles
**Definition:** Individual people or positions that participate in or are affected by the remarriage process.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Represents human actors in the system
- Can be government officials, applicants, legal professionals, or support personnel
- Each role has specific responsibilities and interactions
- Examples: "NADRA Officer," "Divorced Applicant," "Family Court Judge"

### Processes
**Definition:** High-level legal/administrative pathways that group multiple related systems together to achieve a major lifecycle change.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Represents official government-defined procedures
- Contains multiple systems and steps in sequence
- Focuses on legal requirements and compliance
- Examples: "Divorce Process," "Remarriage Process," "Widowhood Process"

### Departments
**Definition:** Government organizations or institutional units responsible for operating systems and implementing processes.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Organizational entities that house multiple systems
- Have jurisdiction and authority over specific areas
- Provide infrastructure and personnel for service delivery
- Examples: "Union Council," "NADRA," "Family Courts"

### Documents
**Definition:** Physical or digital paperwork, certificates, forms, and records required as inputs or generated as outputs by systems.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Can be input documents (required to start) or output documents (generated upon completion)
- Have validity periods and issuing authorities
- Essential for legal compliance and verification
- Examples: "Divorce Certificate," "Form-A Application," "Marriage Permission Letter"

### Stages
**Definition:** User experience phases that represent where applicants are in their emotional and practical journey through the remarriage process.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Represents the human experience perspective
- Captures emotional state and primary needs at each point
- Focused on user feelings, challenges, and support requirements
- Examples: "Pre-Filing Contemplation," "NADRA Processing," "Post-Divorce Transition"

## Key Distinctions

### System vs Department
**Common Confusion:** People often think these are the same thing.

**System = What You Do**
- Specific workflow or procedure
- User interaction and experience
- "Divorce Certificate Processing" (the actual steps you complete)

**Department = Who Runs It**
- Organizational unit or institution
- Administrative structure
- "NADRA" (the government agency that operates the system)

**Example:** You go through the "Divorce Certificate Processing" **system** (filling forms, biometric verification, waiting for approval), which is operated by the "NADRA" **department** (the national registration authority).

### Process vs Stage
**Common Confusion:** Both seem to describe sequences, but serve different purposes.

**Process = Government's View**
- Legal/administrative sequence defined by law
- What officially needs to happen according to regulations
- System-focused and compliance-driven
- "Divorce Process" (the legal steps required by Pakistani law)

**Stage = User's View**
- Human experience and emotional journey
- Where someone is in their personal journey
- User-focused and experience-driven
- "Arbitration Process Stage" (feeling frustrated with mandatory sessions)

**Example:** Two people in the same "Divorce Process" might be at different **stages** - one anxious about starting, another frustrated with delays.
